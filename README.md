# Hello

My website: https://epolite.net/

If you want to email me, my email is on my GitHub profile (to prevent scraping).

You can also [encrypt the email](https://encrypt.epolite.net/) before sending it :)

## TempMail

I made a [temporary email service provider](https://tempmail.lol) that allows you to generate temporary emails (you can also see this in [@tempmail-lol](https://github.com/tempmail-lol).

There are APIs available for TempMail as well.
